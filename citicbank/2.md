# Switch可以用的参数种类
A switch works with the `byte`, `short`, `char`, and `int` primitive data types. It also works with `enumerated types` 
(discussed in EnumTypes), the `String` class, and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types: `Character`, 
`Byte`, `Short`, and `Integer`(discussed in Numbers and Strings).
